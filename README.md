# Traffic-Light-Simulator-in-emu8086
Steps  in Project: Draw the traffic lights at each side of the street.  Traffic light has three colors: red, yellow, green.<br>  
Case 1: represents signal 1 is green and others are  red. <br> 
Case 2: represents signal 2 is green and others are  red. <br> 
Case 3: represents signal 3 is green and others are  red. <br> 
Case 4: represents signal 4 is green and others are  red.  <br> 
In each case, we have green delay and yellow delay at which the car moves.  The car will not move at red delay  If the car travels in 60km per hour then it will not stop in any signal.<br>
